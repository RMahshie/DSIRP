# Algorithm Analysis

## Big O Notation Questions
1. They are all the same: cubic
2. cubic
3. it's linear
4. which ever is a higher magnitue is the order
5. f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub> = O(g + h)
6. f<sub>1</sub> x f<sub>2</sub> = O(gh)

## Sorting Questions
1. In comparison based sorting, elements of an array are compared with each other to find the sorted array. The best worst case order of growth is n<sup>2</sup>is n x n!.
2. n<sup>2</sup> order of growth
3. O(w x n) n is number of keys and w is key length
4. An algorithm is considered stable if if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input data set. Essentially stability is how it treats equal values.
5. Bogosort is the worst sort
6. The c library uses qsort which is not stable. Python uses Tim sort which is stable.
7. Because it has a guarenteed best, worst, and average runtime of nlog(n)
